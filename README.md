a quick TUI mensa menu for the TU Dortmund university i whipped up in Go because i was bored

*beware of awful code quality, this is literally my first Go project and you WILL notice!*

also using [bubble tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) because it was cool <sub>tbf that's the whole reason i did this in Go in the first place</sub>
